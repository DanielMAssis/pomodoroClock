# Pomodoro Clock
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.
